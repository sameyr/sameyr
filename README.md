I'm currently a third-year computer engineering student with a strong interest in coding and a passion for learning new technical concepts. 
At the moment, I am actively learning full-stack web development and honing my skills in the C-programming language.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I also have enthusiasm for physical fitness and enjoy working out regularly.

Chess and solving Rubik's Cube are two of my favourite passtime.
